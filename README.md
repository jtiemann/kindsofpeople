web version adds rulesets, aka which direction next is optimal given data/rules

node branch just run "node index.js" (no dependencies despite papckage.json showing typical rxjs, ramda)
web branch adds visuals, download and drag index.html to browser
note: easily change speed of visualization, size of random maze, and/or add rulesets
